# x_make_graphviz_x — Production Ledger

I record every substantive change to this diagram engine here. Entries follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning so audits can correlate SVG artefacts with the exact code that produced them.

## [0.20.4] - 2025-10-15
### Changed
- Routed SVG exports through the shared `export_graphviz_to_svg` helper, recording `ExportResult` metadata and clear failure detail when Graphviz is absent.
- README tightened for the Road to 0.20.4 release to document the exporter handoff and Kanban evidence handshakes.

## [0.20.3] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Updated documentation to reference the Road to 0.20.3 diagram canon and acknowledge the JSON audit flow.

## [0.20.2] - 2025-10-14
### Changed
- Recut the README to align diagrams with the Road to 0.20.2 blueprint and documented the control-room expectations for the refreshed charts.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Updated README links and language to point at the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger so Graphviz docs track the active roadmap.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Reframed the README and changelog in the control-room voice to align with the Road to 0.20.0 documentation standard.
- Linked Graphviz helpers to the orchestrator and documentation stacks for rapid situational awareness.

### Changed
- Established expectations for diagram contributions: tests, Change Control entries, and clean outputs, no excuses.
