# Changelog â€” Walter White's Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_graphviz_x are tracked here. We stick to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) structure and Semantic Versioning because diagrams deserve just as much discipline as chemistry.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
