# Changelog â€” Control Room Production Log

All notable changes to x_make_graphviz_x are tracked here. We stick to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) structure and Semantic Versioning because diagrams deserve just as much discipline as chemistry.

## [0.20.1] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Updated README links and language to point at the Road to 0.20.1 control-room ledger so Graphviz docs track the active roadmap.

## [0.20.0-prep] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Reframed the README and changelog in the control-room voice to align with the Road to 0.20.0 documentation standard.
- Linked Graphviz helpers to the orchestrator and documentation stacks for rapid situational awareness.

### Changed
- Established expectations for diagram contributions: tests, Change Control entries, and clean outputs, no excuses.
